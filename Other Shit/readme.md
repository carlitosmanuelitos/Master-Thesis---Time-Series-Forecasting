Clear Ownership & Access: Establishing clear data ownership and access methods is crucial, especially with frequent job changes, to maintain accountability and ease of use.
Integration & Automation: There is a strong need for better integration of data tools into daily operations and automation to reduce manual maintenance, thereby increasing efficiency and adoption.
User-Friendliness & Training: Enhancing the user availability and providing training can improve the adoption and value of current data managements practices.
Specific Segregation: Customizing data management processes to fit specific product or market requirements can increase their value and relevance to the teams on daily activities.
Collaboration & Alignment: Encouraging collaboration and alignment between Data Teams, Product Teams and Business can lead to better management and utilization of data resources.




Segmented Survey Insights
Data Ownership Matrix (Link)
Awareness & Usage: Seen as crucial across product teams for maintaining data ownership, especially with frequent job changes, but lacks consistent updates and clear access methods. Information present is not up-to date.
Insight: Establishing clearer guidelines for data ownership and ensuring regular audits & updates are scheduleds could improve the adoption and value of the matrix.


Solution Data Architecture (Template) (Example - Hybris)
Awareness & Usage: Critical in daily operations for Order Orch and CIAM, less so for F2F where it's underutilized.
Insight: Reducing duplicate efforts and enhancing solution ownership could improve efficiency and relevance, especially in segments where it's currently underutilized. Clarifying roles and responsibilities within the solution team and data team could improve overall adoption. 


Data Impact Assessment: (Template) (Example - Tax Engine Integration)
Awareness & Usage: High awareness across all teams but deemed low value, indicating it's not regularly used or is not considered relevant to daily operations across teams.
Insight: The Epic task is perceived as non-essential except for specific situations. This might call for a refactoring of its application under Business Epics or a re-adjustment to align better with business needs and product needs.


Data Lineage: (Solidatus)
Awareness & Usage: Recognized for its potential value but is held back by maintenance issues (not being up to date, incomplete data being present) and lack of user-friendliness.
Insight: Improving the tool’s integration into product workflows and enhancing its user interface could increase its usage and reliability. This could possibly be tackled by the new Atlan integration, but still early to discuss) Review Atlan migration in below confluence link: Atlan Migration - DCX - ATE - Confluence (pconnect.biz) (slightly outdated)


Integration Data Mapping Repository (Link)
Awareness & Usage: Valuable but needs to be showed and better integrated into daily activities, with a high need for automation to reduce manual effort into keeping information stored up to date.
Insight: Automating the repository management and enhancing visibility could increase its delivered value and adoption by Product Teams. Simplifying the interface for better segmentation across systems integration would also be beneficial. Possibility for deploying specific tool for data integration mapping (Mulesoft Anypoint Studio - Graphically Construct a Mapping)
 
Reference Data Repository (Link)
Awareness & Usage: Highly valued across all segments, detailing its positive impact in daily operations. Not applicable to DCX.
Insight: Streamlining its use and addressing inconsistencies between systems could improve operational efficiency and effectiveness. Making sure that the data is consistent and updated could help different product team needs.




Data Models (Logical, Physical & Mapping) (Data Models)
Awareness & Usage: Valued for onboarding new team members and specific products applications but needs enrichment and less manual maintenance.
Insight: Automating updates and improvimg low levels details could make these models more useful and reduce the workload. Difficulty in automating and generating without manual upkeep.




PII Data (Link)
Awareness & Usage: Recognized for compliance importance but challenged by manual updates and multiplicity of sources. Information not up to date. Not revelant across all product teams.
Insight: Streamlining sources and automating updates could ensure compliance and reduce the burden.




Data Validation Rules & Data Quality Index:
DVR: Link
DQI: Link
Awareness & Usage: Recognized importance. These need to be current, no value is foreseen if data is outdated. Unalignment in terms of ownership, possibility between split ownership among Data teams and Product teams. Possible benefit if this segment would be segregated both by product as well as markets instead of globally to ensure specific markets requirements are captured.
Insight: Ensuring these rules are up-to-date, easily extractable, and managed by data teams with alignment with product teams. Regular revisions to ensure consistency and accuracy should be mandatory.
Data Reconciliation (PowerBI Report)

Awareness & Usage: Acknowledged by with moderate value. This points to varying needs and the importance of customizing the process to fit different product requirements.
Insight: Enhancing access for product teams and adapting the process for specific products/markets requirements could provide significant benefits. 




Industry Standard Research



Reference Data Repository:

Issue: There’s a requirement to transition from the current practice of maintaining the Reference Data Repository on Confluence due to several inefficiencies. The existing data is outdated and demands significant manual maintenance. Furthermore, there’s a lack of segmentation based on Product or Market-specific needs.

In Detail:

The Reference Data Repository should have the capability to store not just canonical reference data (which is independent of any specific application), but also data that is specific to a product or market.
The system should be designed with flexibility in mind to accommodate potential future enhancements.
The structure needs to be revamped with the perspective of Data Users to enhance its perceived value (UI).
The system should support versioning to track changes over time.
It should provide precise descriptions of objects and features.
Wherever feasible, automation should be implemented for data extraction between systems.
