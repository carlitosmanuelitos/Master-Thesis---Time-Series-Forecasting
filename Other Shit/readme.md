Type	Data deliverable	Awareness (yes/no)	Value (1- not useful, 2 - neutral, 3 - useful	Comments
Order Orch	Data Impact Assessment	Y	1	not used regularly
Order Orch	Data Lineage	N	2	Useful if reliable and more user friendly
Order Orch	Data Models (Logical, Physical & Mapping)	N	3	Useful for someone who is new and needs onboarding
Order Orch	Data Ownership Matrix	N	3	useful if up to date, especially with people changing jobs
Order Orch	Data Quality Index	N	3	
Order Orch	Data Reconcialtion	N	3	Product team needs to get access to the dashboard, the roles were already shared
Order Orch	Data Remediation	Y	3	Process well known and appreciated. Commerce team is Top 1 of all teams raising tickets.
Order Orch	Data Validation Rules & Data Quality	N	3	"Needs to be kept up to date

Ownership with the data team (if available)"
Order Orch	Definitions of Done within User Story	N	2	not using
Order Orch	Integration Data Mapping Repository	N	3	Looks useful but needs publicizing
Order Orch	PII Data	N	1	not something we would use
Order Orch	Reference data in Confluence	Y	3	Just one list used on a regular basis
Order Orch	Solution Data Architecture	Y	3	use on a day to day basis
F2F	Reference data in Confluence	Y	3	Not applicable to DCX 
F2F	Integration Data Mapping Repository	Y	3	Won't work in DCX WoW
F2F	Data Models (Logical, Physical & Mapping)	Y	NA	Specifically for DA and target systems
F2F	Data Validation Rules & Data Quality	Y/N	3	Not up to date
F2F	Data Lineage 	Y	3	Challenge to maintain it and keep up to date
F2F				How to fit the tool into day to day work
F2F	PII Data	Y/N	3	Several sources for PII data
F2F	Data Ownership Matrix	Y	3	Needed to show clear capability ownership in DCX,
F2F				not the page in Confluence
F2F				would be good to add the methods of accessing the data
F2F				there needs to be an understanding from the business of data which is available to them
F2F	Solution Data Architecture	N	1	Should be in LeanIX
F2F	Data Impact Assessment	Y	1	Not relevant to the line of work
F2F				Not the priority as per current prioritisation 
F2F	Definitions of Done within User Story	Y	1	Do not help the quality of solution,
F2F				easily to manipulate,
F2F				too cumbersome,
F2F				no check whether the work was done 
F2F				make them easier, anyone can sign them off, it needs to be someone who is a specialist in the area
F2F	Data Reconciliation	Y	2	The current process is designed for the DCE2, for the DCX we should improve it. 
F2F	Data Remediation	Y	2	When DCX product will be responsible for their own DQ, it should be improved. 
F2F	Data Quality Index	N	2	Current design and implementation not really design for DCX, required improvements. 
CIAM	Reference data in Confluence	Y	3	Lack of consistency between the systems led to P1s
CIAM	Integration Data Mapping Repository	N	NA	Updated manually
CIAM				A lot of effort to maintain and keep up to date
CIAM				Products themselves should manage this information
CIAM				The management should be automated to avoid manual intervention
CIAM	Data Models (Logical, Physical & Mapping)	Y	3	This can be enriched with more information, e.g. definition, or actions related to specific fields
CIAM				Limit manual work involved in the update
CIAM	Data Validation Rules & Data Quality	Y	1	The information per market would be useful, not in the current global form
CIAM				Not on Confluence, it should be available in the Back Office, easily extractable 
CIAM				Product Teams should manage that 
CIAM	Data Lineage 	Y	1	Product Teams are aware of it but not aware of how it can be useful to them
CIAM				Lack of ownership in terms of updates to the system, is it automatic
CIAM				Not user friendly, too much information looks squashed
CIAM				Potentially useful if the current problems are resolved
CIAM	PII Data	N	1	Might be useful for compliance reasons if not manual and up to date
CIAM	Data Ownership Matrix	N	1	
CIAM	Solution Data Architecture	Y	2	Product team should own it
CIAM				Duplicate effort with regards to this Confluence page and LeanIX
CIAM	Data Impact Assessment	Y	2	At present it is needed on case by case basis
CIAM				In future it may need to be eliminated by upgrading our DM practices 
CIAM	Definitions of Done within User Story	Y	2 (3 in the new form)	Data element should stay within DoDs but should be made leaner 




Other comments:
Data requirements should come from the business
Other comments:
costly maintenance
ownership has to be shifted to Products
automated process
there needs to be a transition period between DCE2 WoW and the new PBO
Other comments:
trust in the Data Team in this respect
Would like to see more synergy between Product and Data teams
Relying on SDA pages but DIA pages not used
